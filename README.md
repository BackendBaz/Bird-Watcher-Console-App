# Instructions

You're an avid bird watcher who keeps track of how many birds have visited your garden in the last seven days.

You have six tasks, all dealing with the numbers of birds that visited your garden.

1. Check what the counts were last week
2. Check how many birds visited today
3. Increment today's count
4. Check if there was a day with no visiting birds
   - It returns `true` if there was a day at which **zero birds visited the garden**; otherwise, returns `false`.
5. Calculate the number of visiting birds for the first number of days
   - It returns the number of birds that have visited your garden from the start of the week, but limit the count to the specified number of days from the beginning of the week.
6. Calculate the number of busy days
